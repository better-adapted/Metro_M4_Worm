# Project Title

Worm game like snake to show my kids some coding

Adafruit M4 Metro
Adafruit RGB display with their Library single 64x32 unit
4 Axis joystick using bounce2 lib

## Getting Started

hook up !
open in arduino and compile - once you have got the libs downloaded

### Prerequisites

Basic compiling - Arduino with adafruit metro m4 installed 

personally I am using Visual GDB plugin for heavy work - I find VGDB very good for debugging non-standard arduino type hardware - with a Segger J-link

*NOTE if using VGDB You will need to modify the file "M4_Metro_Worm_P5_VGDB.vgdbproj" and change the <SketchSubdirectory> to where you have it installed

- Normally I try to import to Atmel Studio 7.0 but the SAMD51 import is not working - maybe ask microchip/atmel about this...

I HAVE KEPT THIS SIMPLE FOR A 10 YEAR OLD!
